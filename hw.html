    <div id="id1"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</div>
    <div id="id2">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This
    separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation. </div>
    <div id="id3">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,and by voice.</div>
